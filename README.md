 ### ðŸ’¡ About the Project:
 My goal for this project was to create an accurate mockup of the Adyen clone.
 
 
  ###  Motivation:
  I chose the Adyen website out of a bunch of other options since it appealed to me the most. I found it to be a good chance to practice on a project that needs heavy implementation of CSS grid while applying the direction of a flat design, which is what I aesthetically like.
  
  
  ***I took this chance to practice and develop my bootstrap skills,<br>
  which I solely used to get this project done***

***The end goal turned out to be a replica of the Original website***
